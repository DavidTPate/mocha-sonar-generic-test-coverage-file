# mocha-sonar-generic-test-coverage-file
Basically the same reporter as mocha-sonar-generic-test-coverage reporter(https://github.com/mageddo/mocha-sonar-generic-test-coverage), but writes the output to a file. And some issues fixed.

By default, the output file would be "gunit.xml" located in root folder of the same project.
